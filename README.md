# 🧭 SafeGuide

**SafeGuide** is an interactive travel guide designed to help people understand the status of tourist destinations by incorporating crime data, dangerous zones, crowded areas, and must-visit locations. The platform provides clear and useful visualizations to help travelers make safer, data-driven decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The main idea of SafeGuide is to develop a mobile application that provides reliable and up-to-date information about tourist destinations using a generative AI capable of processing large volumes of data. Anyone planning a trip can consult the app and gain insight into the real situation of the place they want to visit, with a focus on:

---

### 🔐 Safety and Prevention

- **Crime maps and dangerous zones**: The app visually highlights areas with higher crime incidence, allowing users to avoid high-risk areas and choose safer routes.
- **Real-time alerts**: By integrating open data and local sources, the app will notify users of recent incidents or unsafe events.

---

### 🛣️ Infrastructure and Access

- Stay informed about busy zones and optimal access routes.

---

### 📍 Places to Visit

- **Personalized recommendations**: Using generative AI, the app suggests historic sites, museums, parks, and local gastronomy tailored to user interests (e.g., family, adventure, cultural tourism).
- **User reviews and summaries**: AI will generate short summaries from reviews posted on social media, websites, and travel platforms to highlight the reputation and key features of each place.

---

### 🧭 Current Functionality (Dash App)

This version, built using Dash + Folium, includes:

#### 🔍 Homicide Dashboard

- Filter data by **province** and **type of death**.
- Visualize weapon usage with a histogram chart, segmented by gender.

#### 🗺️ Interactive Map

- Shows **tourist attractions** with markers and popups using **Folium**.
- Includes the attraction name, category, and type.
